            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Nicole Icen, from Marietta, Georgia, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself with you. Growing up, I always had dogs and my older sister by my side, with the recent addition of my cat Pj. Soccer has been a huge part of my life, providing a safe space where I could truly be myself. My journey began at Mercer University, where I played soccer and built amazing friendships. I then transferred to Mizzou to complete my MBA in marketing analytics, continuing to thrive both on and off the field. These experiences have shaped me into the person I am today, instilling in me a passion for connecting with others no matter their background. I’m currently a student, working hard to finish my studies while staying involved in soccer and other activities. I look forward to applying my skills and experiences in my future career, making a positive impact in whatever field I choose to pursue.</p>

                <p>I am a graduate of Mercer University, where I majored in both Marketing and Management. My academic journey at Mercer was marked by strong performance in upper-level classes, where I applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. My time at Mercer was also defined by my athletic achievements, particularly receiving the SoCon Player of the Year award in 2019 and continuing my leadership role as team captain. Currently, I am furthering my education as an MBA candidate in Marketing Analytics at the University of Missouri, where I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and marketing strategies.</p>
