            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Nicole Icen, from Marietta, Georgia, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself with you. Growing up, I always had dogs and my older sister by my side, with the recent addition of my cat Pj. Soccer has been a huge part of my life, providing a safe space where I could truly be myself. My journey began at Mercer University, where I played soccer and built amazing friendships. I then transferred to Mizzou to complete my MBA in marketing analytics, continuing to thrive both on and off the field. These experiences have shaped me into the person I am today, instilling in me a passion for connecting with others no matter their background. I’m currently a student, working hard to finish my studies while staying involved in soccer and other activities. I look forward to applying my skills and experiences in my future career, making a positive impact in whatever field I choose to pursue.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of Mercer University, where I majored in both Marketing and Management. My academic journey at Mercer was marked by strong performance in upper-level classes, where I applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. My time at Mercer was also defined by my athletic achievements, particularly receiving the SoCon Player of the Year award in 2019 and continuing my leadership role as team captain. Currently, I am furthering my education as an MBA candidate in Marketing Analytics at the University of Missouri, where I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and marketing strategies.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Engagement campaign:</strong> For an 8-week engagement campaign during the World Cup, I designed interactive Instagram stories for the 90 Plus Training account, which boasts 19,000 followers. The goal was to excite young soccer enthusiasts and boost engagement. I created a series of engaging questions, polls, and quizzes tailored to the World Cup, focusing on predictions, favorite teams, and player trivia. This strategy capitalized on the global soccer fever, increasing interaction and fostering a vibrant online community. The campaign successfully heightened anticipation for the World Cup and enhanced the account's engagement metrics among its young audience.</p>
            <p>During the project, I successfully grew 90+ Training's overall engagement and expanded my knowledge about paid ads and other relevant Instagram metrics. With guidance from Nate, the brand owner, I created more engaging content for future reels featured on his page.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Intern Guide:</strong> At Norfolk Southern, I developed an intern guide to streamline the onboarding process for future interns. Identifying a gap in the existing procedure, I created this guide to enable new interns to work more independently and reduce their reliance on supervisors. The guide covered essential processes, making it easier for interns to understand and perform basic tasks quickly and efficiently. This initiative aimed to enhance the learning experience, allowing interns to focus on more complex aspects of their roles and gain more from their internships. The guide effectively simplified onboarding and improved overall intern productivity and experience.</p>
            <p>At Norfolk Southern, I was tasked with optimizing train car movement across the country. During a challenging period of crew and train power shortages, we needed to identify and address the root causes. Collaborating with managers and utilizing systems like Mainframe, we pinpointed trouble areas and investigated effective solutions.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Press Sports App:</strong> (an app designed for up-and-coming student athletes looking to showcase their best moments on the field, court, or track) I was tasked with boosting engagement on the Press Sports App's Snapchat and Twitter accounts, which initially had minimal activity. Noticing Snapchat's strong interest in basketball, I leveraged this insight to drive a 231% increase in engagement. My strategy consistently garnered over 2 million views on Snapchat Spotlight. My efforts were recognized in weekly meetings for achieving significant growth metrics and meeting targets. This proj
