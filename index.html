        <p>Welcome to Nicole Icen's professional portfolio, where I share my experiences and demonstrate the unique value I bring to the field of marketing through my creativity and experience in marketing analytics.</p>
        <p>My professional portfolio showcases my academic and athletic journey, practical experiences, and creative endeavors. As a graduate of Mercer University with dual majors in Marketing and Management, and currently pursuing an MBA in Marketing Analytics at the University of Missouri, I bring a strong academic foundation to the table. My leadership skills were honed as the SoCon player of the year and team captain, fostering a productive environment. My internships at Norfolk Southern, the Atlanta Open, and Press Sports provided valuable insights into the business world and enhanced my ability to connect with diverse individuals. At Press Sports, I grew Snapchat spotlight views to over two million through strategic efforts. Proficient in SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and SAS, I excel at creating reports, visuals, and drawing meaningful conclusions from datasets. My passion for sports, understanding people, and creativity in graphic design further define my unique value in the marketing field.</p>
