            <h2>Intern Guide</h2>
            <p>At Norfolk Southern, I was tasked with optimizing train car movement across the country. During a challenging period of crew and train power shortages, we needed to identify and address the root causes. Collaborating with managers and utilizing systems like Mainframe, we pinpointed trouble areas and investigated effective solutions.</p>
