            <h2>Engagement Campaign</h2>
            <p>For an 8-week engagement campaign during the World Cup, I designed interactive Instagram stories for the 90 Plus Training account, which boasts 19,000 followers. The goal was to excite young soccer enthusiasts and boost engagement. I created a series of engaging questions, polls, and quizzes tailored to the World Cup, focusing on predictions, favorite teams, and player trivia. This strategy capitalized on the global soccer fever, increasing interaction and fostering a vibrant online community.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>The campaign successfully heightened anticipation for the World Cup and enhanced the account's engagement metrics among its young audience. During the project, I successfully grew 90+ Training's overall engagement and expanded my knowledge about paid ads and other relevant Instagram metrics. With guidance from Nate, the brand owner, I created more engaging content for future reels featured on his page.</p>
