            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of Mercer University, where I majored in both Marketing and Management. My academic journey at Mercer was marked by strong performance in upper-level classes, where I applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. My time at Mercer was also defined by my athletic achievements, particularly receiving the SoCon Player of the Year award in 2019 and continuing my leadership role as team captain. Currently, I am furthering my education as an MBA candidate in Marketing Analytics at the University of Missouri, where I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and marketing strategies.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Marietta, Georgia, soccer was a significant part of my life. Playing soccer in college provided me with an opportunity to develop discipline and a strong work ethic. As a senior, I took on the role of captain, which allowed me to foster strong relationships with my teammates and coaching staff. Together, we cultivated a healthy and productive environment that was conducive to both personal and team growth. These experiences have greatly shaped my leadership skills and my ability to work effectively in a team setting.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
            <p>During the summers between school and soccer seasons, I participated in internships that enriched my understanding of the business world. At Norfolk Southern, I helped optimize train car movements across the country by collaborating with managers and utilizing systems like Mainframe. This experience taught me the importance of identifying and addressing operational challenges. My internship at the Atlanta Open provided insights into event management and the sports industry. Most recently, at Press Sports, I managed social media platforms like Twitter and Snapchat. Through strategic efforts, I successfully grew Snapchat Spotlight views to over two million, demonstrating my ability to drive engagement and leverage social media metrics.</p>

My career goals include securing a role in marketing, preferably SEO-related, where I can apply my analytical skills and creativity. I am also interested in entry-level marketing positions at agencies, where I can further develop my skills and gain valuable experience.
