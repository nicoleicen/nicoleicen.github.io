            <h2>Press Sports</h2>
            <p>Press Sports App: (an app designed for up-and-coming student athletes looking to showcase their best moments on the field, court, or track) I was tasked with boosting engagement on the Press Sports App's Snapchat and Twitter accounts, which initially had minimal activity. Noticing Snapchat's strong interest in basketball, I leveraged this insight to drive a 231% increase in engagement. My strategy consistently garnered over 2 million views on Snapchat Spotlight. My efforts were recognized in weekly meetings for achieving significant growth metrics and meeting targets. This project not only revitalized the app's social media presence but also highlighted the effectiveness of targeted content strategies in driving user engagement and platform visibility.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>At Press Sports, my role was to consistently post on social media platforms to increase brand awareness. By analyzing metrics, I identified effective strategies and areas needing improvement. Even if I wasn't familiar with a trending sport, I researched popular lingo and integrated it into our content to connect with like-minded users and expedite growth.</p>
